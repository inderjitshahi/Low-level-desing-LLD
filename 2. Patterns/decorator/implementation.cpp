/*
Decorator Pattern allows you to add new behavior to an object dynamically without changing its existing code.
    Uses composition over inheritance
    Wraps an object inside another object that has the same interface
    Behaviors can be stacked at runtime.

Use it when:
✔ You want to add features at runtime
✔ You want to avoid too many subclasses


Core idea:
    Component → Interface
    ConcreteComponent → Base behavior
    Decorator → Wraps Component
    ConcreteDecorators → Add features
