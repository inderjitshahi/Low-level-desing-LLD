Singleton ensures:
    Only ONE instance of a class exists.
    Provides a global access point to that instance, i.e. It essentially turns the object into a "Single Source of Truth" that is available everywhere.

“We make the constructor private, prevent copying, and expose a static method that returns the single instance.”
this is always a pinter to current object
