/*
Factory Method Pattern defines an interface for creating an object, but lets subclasses decide which class to instantiate.
In short:
    -Creation logic is separated
    -Client code depends on abstraction, not concrete classes

The real power of this pattern emerges when the Client (the code that uses the vehicle) doesn't know which factory it's getting, see runLogistics function

The main point or goal of implementing this pattern is that all the factory return the same type of vehicle. That is the interface.
